# WalkieTalkie
Java app that works as a WalkieTalkie with a simple interface

It is quite a simple walkie-talkie. The first user will join using the desired IP, will get an user, talk and then say "cambio" in order to let the other person join and be able to talk.
After that, the other person joins in the same way, picks an user, talks and says "cambio" again to let the other user answer, like a real walkie-talkie. When "corto" (written in various ways) is said, the connection cuts as in, you know,

#A WalkieTalkie.
